# CryptoChallenges

I've decided to catalog (i.e. show) my work using Jupyter notebooks. Notebook
files are simply JSON files that GitHub knows how to render. I'm using
Python 3.8.2 on Windows, but nothing in the notebooks is platform specific
and should be platform agnostic. That said, I make extensive use of f-strings,
so Python 3.6+ is required.

## Running Notebooks

```
pip install -u jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

This will install Jupyter onto your box and then starts up a Jupyter process,
which should open up a browser tab with the contents of the directory displayed.
